# Residential wood burning and pulmonary function in the Agricultural Lung Health Study
 This analysis was undertaken to assess if wood burning exposure was related to 
 pulmonary function, and a publication is in review now. The repository will be
 updated with a citation when available. In the meantime, the abstract is below, 
 and you can scroll through the executed code at https://juliedwhite.github.io/Woodsmoke_PFTs/
 
 
*Background*  
In low- and middle-income countries, burning biomass indoors for cooking or 
heating has been associated with poorer lung function. In high-income countries, 
wood, a form of biomass, is commonly used for heating in rural areas, with 
increasing prevalence. However, in these settings the potential impact of chronic 
indoor woodsmoke exposure on pulmonary function is little studied.

*Objective*  
We evaluated the association of residential wood burning with pulmonary function 
in a case-control study of asthma nested within a US rural cohort. 

*Methods*  
Using sample weighted multivariable linear regression, we estimated associations 
between some and frequent wood burning, both relative to no exposure, in 
relation to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced 
vital capacity (FVC), their ratio (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC), and fractional exhaled 
nitric oxide (FeNO). We examined effect modification by smoking or asthma status. 

*Results*  
Among all participants and within smoking groups, wood burning was not appreciably 
related to pulmonary function. However, in asthmatic individuals (n = 1,083), 
frequent wood burning was significantly associated with lower FEV<sub>1</sub> 
(β: -164 ml; 95% CI: -261, -66 ml), FVC (β: -125 ml; 95% CI: -230, -20 ml), 
and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (β: -2%; 95% CI: -4, -0.4%), whereas no appreciable 
association was seen in individuals without asthma (n = 1,732).  These 
differences in association by asthma were statistically significant for 
FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (P<sub>interaction</sub> FEV<sub>1</sub> = 0.0044; 
<sub>interaction</sub> FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC = 0.049). Frequent wood burning was also 
associated with higher FeNO levels in all individuals (n = 2,598; β: 0.1 ln(ppb); 
95% CI: 0.02, 0.2 ln(ppb)), but associations did not differ by asthma or smoking 
status.  

*Discussion*  
Frequent exposure to residential wood burning was associated with a measure of 
airway inflammation (FeNO) among all individuals, and with lower pulmonary 
function among asthmatic individuals. This group may wish to reduce wood burning 
or consider using air filtration devices.
